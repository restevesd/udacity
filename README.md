- udacity.ipynb ==> Notebook to investigate about point of interest.
- datos.csv  ==> Dataset with coordinates of point of interest.
- visualizations ==> Plots and graphs generated while analyzing data.

## Motivation
Working on these aspects related to business or real-world applications of how the data could be used:
- Location Overview
- Types of business nearby
- Where to put a point of attention

## Results 
- Found that we can divide the bank's points of attention into **two categories**
- In one category we can see that a common characteristic is being close to **seafood restaurants**, then **fast food restaurants**. 
- In cluster 2 we see that **commercial premises for office elements predominate**
